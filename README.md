<h3 align="center">After working several years in HR for Tech/IT profiles at companies such as Nokia and Ubisoft, I decided in 2024 to start a new career path in Data Analysis & Data Science.</h3>

<p align="justify">I worked several years in Human Resources as a Partner for employees, unions and managers for Tech/IT profiles (engineers / PhD) in high-tech companies (Nokia, Ubisoft). During my HR journey, I had the opportunity to work with people from different backgrounds. As a consequence, I am fully able to <b> work and adapt my speech to different profiles </b> (CEO, executives, managers, tech/non-tech profiles).</p>

<p align="justify">In 2024, I had the opportunity to start a new career path. I decided it was my turn to join the Tech side and started get interested in Data. 
Through an <b> intensive training of 450h with Jedha Bootcamp </b> in 2024 (#1 Data Science Bootcamp in Europe), I developed the required languages/skills to work in Data.</p>
